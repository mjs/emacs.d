;;; Change Log:
;; 
;; Version 0.3.1
;;  [laynor@gmail.com:]
;;  Added some small fixes, and promoted the experimental stuff to 
;;  stable, as it seems to work well and not loading it caused problems.
;; Version 0.3.0      
;;  [laynor@gmail.com:]
;;  - [NEW] register support on text object commands
;;  - [NEW] issuing : when visual selecting has a behavior closer to vim's
;;  [jasonspiro3@gmail.com:]
;;  - [FIX]: The Enter key now does what it should do -- insert a
;;    newline -- even when longlines-mode is on.
;;  - Comment changes.
;; 
;; Version 0.2.6.9
;;  [laynor@gmail.com:]
;; - [FIX & NEW] Text Objects support fixed and integrated with viper. Now
;;   count works (i.e. you can do 3caw and it works correctly), and it's
;;   possible to repeat the commands with ".".
;;   
;; Version 0.2.6.8
;;  [laynor@gmail.com:]
;; - [NEW]: Text object support: paren blocks, sentences, word, Words, quoted expressions,
;;   paragraphs. Delete and change commands.
;;   Example commands : diw ci( das etc.
;; - [FIX]: It's now possible to exit visual mode by pressing the ESC key or ^[
;;
;; Version 0.2.6.7
;;  [jasonspiro3@gmail.com:]
;;  - No code changes.
;;  - Fixed up "thanks" section below to mention Mieszko <sillyfox at yahoo.com>'s full
;;    name.  He wrote a small patch which was included long ago.  I must have 
;;    forgotten to include it in the changelog.
;;
;; Version 0.2.6.6
;;  [laynor@gmail.com:]
;; - Fixed pasting in visual mode, works like in vim now (Experimental, see point 6.
;;   installation instructions) 
;;
;; Version 0.2.6.5
;;  [laynor@gmail.com:]
;; - Fixed some major suckage with the change command. Still alpha, comments welcome,
;;   to use it see the installation instructions, point 6. (it's still experimental)
;; - Cleaned namespace, hope there are no hidden bugs
;; - Fixed loading on emacs snapshot
;;
;; Version 0.2.6.4
;;  [laynor@gmail.com:]
;;  This can probably be considered a major release.
;;  - [NEW and FIX] Rewritten visual mode, v and V variants (no changes to visual block still)
;;    It doesnot use the region like before: highlighting is done thru overlays,
;;    and the region is set inside the command code, before calling the viper 
;;    commands. = in visual mode calls vimpulse-visual-indent-command. The visual mode
;;    (apart form block mode) looks and feels like vim.
;;  - [NEW] Enhanced paren matching. Moving the cursor on a closing paren in normal mode 
;;    now highlights the opening paren. 
;;  - [NEW] Pressing RET in insert mode automatically indents the new line.
;;  - [NEW] ^[ works
;;  - [FIX] a<ESC> leaves the cursor in the same location as it was before (it advanced the 
;;    cursor 1 character before - viper-exit-insert-state's fault)
;;  - [FIX] cW doesn't suck anymore at the end of a line
;;
;; Version 0.2.6.3:
;;  [frank.fischer@s2001.tu-chemnitz.de:]
;;  - Support more visual-block-mode features: insert, append, delete, yank, change.
;;  - Change some vimpulse-functions and some viper-functions to handle
;;    block-mode properly.
;;  - Update documentation to reflect visual-block-mode.
;;  - The '=' command in visual-mode calls 'indent-region'.
;;
;; Version 0.2.6.2:
;;  [jasonspiro3@gmail.com:]
;;  - Improved XEmacs compatibility.
;;  - Small documentation improvements.
;; 
;; Version 0.2.6.1:
;;  [jasonspiro3@gmail.com:]
;;  - Removed duplicate definition of vimpulse-detect-mark-deactivate
;;    and duplicate add-hook call to add the hook.  I must have added
;;    the extra copies by accident when doing my last big merge; now
;;    they are gone.
;; 
;; Version 0.2.6.0:
;;  [jasonspiro3@gmail.com:]
;;  - Merged a patch for the function that powers * and #. Based on
;;    Ryoichi's patch and a cleaned-up version of Weihua's patch --
;;    thanks.  Now * and # will search for entire symbol at point,
;;    including underscores, not just word at point.
;;  - Todo addition.
;; 
;; Version 0.2.5.1:
;;  [jasonspiro3@gmail.com:]
;;  - Redefined viper-adjust-undo to do nothing.  This way, in
;;    insert mode, typing then moving the cursor then typing more
;;    counts as two separately undoable actions instead of one.
;;    Thanks to Weihua JIANG and to max_ from IRC #emacs for the idea.
;;  - Small extra TODO.
;; 
;; Version 0.2.5.0:
;;  [jasonspiro3@gmail.com:]
;;  - I've ignored my local changes for too long.  Here they are:
;;  - added keybindings from a Usenet post by Samuel Padgett
;;  - made change (cw, etc.) commands work more like Vim (my code)
;;  - I removed (setq ex-cycle-other-window nil); although it is very
;;    useful, it merely works around a problem with Viper.  I plan to
;;    discuss it with the Viper maintainer instead.
;;  - other changes and bugfixes from various people
;;  
;; Version 0.2.0.3:
;;  [jasonspiro3@gmail.com:]
;;  - Added Brad's viper-jump-to-tag-at-point
;; 
;; Version 0.2.0.2:
;;  [jasonspiro3@gmail.com:]
;;  - Small C-w keys and doc fixes.
;; 
;; Version 0.2.0.1:
;;  [cppjavaperl:]
;;  - Added support for block visual mode (i.e. rectangle selection).
;;  - Made C-p look for matches *prior* to the cursor, added C-n
;;    binding to look for matches *before* the cursor.  This works 
;;    more like Vim does.
;;  [jasonspiro3@gmail.com:]
;;  - Since vimpulse has no website, I added a prominent 
;;    pointer at the top to the installation instructions.
;; 
;; Version 0.2.0.0: Brad merged in several changes, including:
;;  - exit visual mode when the mark deactivates
;;  - changed the window manipulation to be global
;;  - added gf (goto file at point)
;;  - added \C-] and \C-t, tag jump & pop
;;  - added a helper function for defining keys
;;  - commented out show-paren-function, what is it meant to do?
;; 
;; Version 0.1.0.1: No code changes.  Small documentation changes,
;; including updates on moving-left bug.
;; 
;; Version 0.1: Initial release.
