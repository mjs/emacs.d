;;; Bugs:

;; (We would appreciate very much if you report bugs.)
;; 
;; Known bugs:
;; 
;; - (class of bugs) In visual or line visual mode, pressing things
;;   like C-g or C-SPC tends to confuse Vimpulse and do weird things.
;; 
;; - In visual mode, repeatedly pressing H, M, or L acts weirdly.  (I
;;   wonder if there are other keys that act weirdly in that mode too.)
;;      -in which way? it seems normal (at least with the current version
;;       19/06/2009
;; 
;; - One user who uses an ancient emacs-snapshot (from 2005) mentions
;;   that this mode causes all the keys on his keyboard to stop
;;   working unless he deletes the line that reads 'viper--key-maps
;;   from the macro my-get-emulation-keymap in this file.
;;         -Wasn't this already fixed? I think it is, as there's
;;          the conditional for the emacs version.
;; 
;; - cw with a count doesn't work the same as Vim when the point
;;   is just before a space between words
;;     - Fix plan: try cw with a count, then try dwi with a count; or,
;;       ask on a relevant forum how the commands differ; or, check
;;       how it works in Vi / Vim then check the Vim manual for more
;;       info; then, decide how to best fix.
;;         - Vim's behavior seems unconsistent in this case.
;;           I think making the fix optional would be best, as I (at least)
;;           like more vimpulse behavior in this case (defaulting to 
;;           standard vim behavior though)
;; 
;; - Undo has problems in XEmacs.
