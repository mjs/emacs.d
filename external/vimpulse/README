;;; Usage:

;; The only feature of vimpulse with documentation available is visual
;; mode.
;; 
;; Visual mode:
;; 
;; To use visual mode, press v in normal mode.  Then use the motion
;; commands to select the region.  Then press d to delete, c to
;; change, r to replace, or y to copy.  You can use p to paste.  For
;; linewise visual mode, press V instead of v.  Then you can copy and
;; paste whole lines. If you want go to block visual mode, press C-v.
;; Here you can copy and paste the selected rectangle[*].
;; In block and linewise visual mode you may use I or A the insert or append
;; text before or after the selection in each selected line.
;;
;; [*] Old documentation follows: 
;; ", but you have ;; to use C-p. C-p is used because it was a simple 
;; way to add visual block mode in a way *close* to Vim without having 
;; to hack viper mode to use the normal 'p' key.  In the future, it 
;; would be nice to see vimpulse provide this the "right" way, but at 
;; this point I'm too inexperienced with elisp to make that happen."
;;      -I just made it work with the normal 'p' key, this is sort of 
;;       a hack, as it pushes a non printable string in the kill-ring
;;       and when pasting checks if the current-kill is `equal' to 
;;       the special string, and if it is pastes the rectangle instead.
;;
;; Other features:
;; 
;; This documentation is not written yet.  For now, see the definition
;; of viper-vi-global-user-map right near the beginning of the code.
;; You'll see a list of keys and what function each one calls.  The
;; documentation that comes with Vim -- which is also online at
;; http://vimdoc.sf.net -- may also be helpful.
;;
;; Tips:
;;
;; - Vimpulse makes C-r run "redo" in command mode but you can 
;;   still get reverse i-search by pressing C-s then C-r.
