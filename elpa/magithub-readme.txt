Magithub is a Magit-based interface to Github.

Integrated into Magit workflows, Magithub allows easy Github
repository management.  Supported actions include:

 - pushing brand-new local repositories up to Github
 - creating forks of existing repositories
 - submitting pull requests upstream
 - viewing and creating issues
 - seeing status checks

all from the `magit-status' buffer.

Press `H' in the status buffer to get started -- happy hacking!
